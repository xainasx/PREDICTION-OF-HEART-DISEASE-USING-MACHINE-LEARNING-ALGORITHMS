# Prediction of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains code and resources for predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The project aims to analyze patient data and build predictive models that can help in the early detection of heart disease.

> **Note:** I have also added the research paper referenced in this project to the repository for further reading and context.


## Introduction

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prediction can help in timely treatment and management. This project applies machine learning algorithms to medical data in order to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- User-friendly scripts for training, testing, and result analysis

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (if applicable)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xainasx/PREDICTION-OF-HEART-DISEASE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PREDICTION-OF-HEART-DISEASE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset)).
2. Run the main script or Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate models:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Or open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook HeartDiseasePrediction.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset

The project uses the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) or similar datasets. Please ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory (usually `data/`). I have also added the Heart Diseas.csv file

## Results

After training, the script will display the evaluation metrics for each model (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.). You can compare models and visualize results using the provided plots.

## Paper

The research paper referenced for this project is included in the repository. Please refer to the `Prediction of Heart Diseas.pdf` directory (or the location you have placed it) for details.
